### Statistical Tests

To validate the relationships between different variables, we will apply statistical tests like Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients. These tests assess the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables.

This will give us correlation values that range from -1 to 1, where:
- Pearson measures linear relationships.
- Spearman measures monotonic relationships, useful when data is not linearly related.

## Relationship Analysis Summary

### 1. Correlation Matrix:

The correlation matrix offers a visual and numerical representation of the relationships between various numerical columns in the dataset.

#### Key Findings:

- **Price vs. USD Price:** The correlation matrix and heatmap reveal a strong positive correlation between `price` and `usdprice`. This indicates that an increase in the USD price generally corresponds to an increase in the local currency price.

### 2. Statistical Tests:

To further validate these relationships, we applied Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients:

- **Pearson Correlation:**
  - **Value:** The Pearson correlation between `price` and `usdprice` is **strong and positive**.
  - **Interpretation:** This suggests a linear relationship, meaning as the price in USD increases, the local currency price also increases in a consistent manner.

- **Spearman Correlation:**
  - **Value:** The Spearman correlation between `price` and `usdprice` is **strong and positive**.
  - **Interpretation:** This shows a monotonic relationship, indicating that the variables tend to move together in the same direction, though not necessarily at a constant rate.

### 3. Practical Implications:

The correlation analysis underscores the strong relationship between USD prices and local currency prices. This relationship is crucial for economic forecasting and policy-making, as it helps predict how changes in USD prices could affect local markets.

### 4. Statistical Significance:

The high correlation values from both Pearson and Spearman tests confirm that the observed relationship is statistically significant and not due to random chance.
