## In-Depth Analysis Summary

### 1. Trend Analysis:

Using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model, we analyzed the time-series data for food prices to identify trends and patterns. The ARIMA model is particularly effective for forecasting and understanding the components of the data, including trends and seasonality.

### 2. ARIMA Model Insights:

- Model Order: The ARIMA model used is of order (5, 1, 0), which indicates that the model uses 5 lag observations (AR), one differencing operation (I), and no moving average component (MA).
- Coefficients: The coefficients of the autoregressive terms are significant, suggesting that past - values have a substantial impact on the current price. For instance, ar.L1 has a coefficient of -0.7168, indicating a strong negative relationship with the immediate past value.
- Significance: All the AR terms (from L1 to L5) have p-values close to 0, indicating their significance in the model.
- Residuals: The residuals (difference between observed and predicted values) are captured by sigma2, which is approximately 31,800, reflecting the variance in the data.

### 3. Seasonal Decomposition:

The seasonal decomposition of the food prices breaks down the data into:
- Trend: The long-term progression of the series.
- Seasonal: The repeating short-term cycle in the series.
- Residual: The random variation after removing the trend and seasonal components.

The decomposition provides clear visual insights into how prices fluctuate over time due to seasonal factors.

### 4. Monthly Price Distribution:

The boxplot of monthly price distribution helps in understanding how prices vary across different months. This visualization reveals seasonal patterns and variations in prices, indicating periods of higher or lower prices.

### 5. Statistical Significance:

- Ljung-Box Test: The Ljung-Box test result (Q) is 2.67 with a p-value of 0.10, suggesting that the residuals are not significantly different from white noise, indicating a good fit of the model.
- Jarque-Bera Test: The Jarque-Bera test shows a significant skew (2.06) and kurtosis (11.83), indicating that the data is not normally distributed, which is common in real-world economic data.

### 6. Model Evaluation:

The ARIMA model provides a comprehensive understanding of the price dynamics, allowing for forecasting future prices and analyzing historical trends. The results highlight periods of volatility and stability in food prices, offering valuable insights for further economic analysis and decision-making.

## Relationship Analysis Summary

### 1. Correlation Matrix:

The correlation matrix offers a visual and numerical representation of the relationships between various numerical columns in the dataset.

#### Key Findings:

- **Price vs. USD Price:** The correlation matrix and heatmap reveal a strong positive correlation between `price` and `usdprice`. This indicates that an increase in the USD price generally corresponds to an increase in the local currency price.

### 2. Statistical Tests:

To further validate these relationships, we applied Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients:

- **Pearson Correlation:**
  - **Value:** The Pearson correlation between `price` and `usdprice` is **strong and positive**.
  - **Interpretation:** This suggests a linear relationship, meaning as the price in USD increases, the local currency price also increases in a consistent manner.

- **Spearman Correlation:**
  - **Value:** The Spearman correlation between `price` and `usdprice` is **strong and positive**.
  - **Interpretation:** This shows a monotonic relationship, indicating that the variables tend to move together in the same direction, though not necessarily at a constant rate.

### 3. Practical Implications:

The correlation analysis underscores the strong relationship between USD prices and local currency prices. This relationship is crucial for economic forecasting and policy-making, as it helps predict how changes in USD prices could affect local markets.

### 4. Statistical Significance:

The high correlation values from both Pearson and Spearman tests confirm that the observed relationship is statistically significant and not due to random chance.

## Impact of Oil Prices Summary

### 1. Multivariate Analysis:

The analysis explores the relationship between oil prices and food prices using regression models. The steps include preparing the dataset, fitting a linear regression model, and visualizing the results.

Key Findings:

- **Dataset Preparation:** We filtered the dataset to include only rows where the commodity is 'Fuel (diesel)' or 'Fuel (petrol-gasoline)' for oil prices and excluded these for food prices. The datasets were merged on the 'date' column to align fuel and food prices for the analysis.

- **Regression Model:** A linear regression model was fit to predict food prices based on fuel prices.
  - **Pearson Correlation:** The Pearson correlation between fuel prices and food prices is calculated to be strong and positive. This suggests that as oil prices increase, food prices also tend to increase.
  - **Coefficient for Fuel Price:** The regression coefficient for fuel price indicates the strength and direction of the impact of fuel prices on food prices. A positive coefficient means an increase in fuel prices leads to an increase in food prices.
  - **Intercept:** The intercept term provides the expected food price when the fuel price is zero.

### 2. Visualization:

- **Predicted vs Actual Food Prices:** The scatter plot of actual vs predicted food prices shows the model's performance. The closer the points are to the red 'Perfect Fit' line, the better the model's predictions.

### 3. Model Evaluation:

After fitting the model and making predictions, we assessed the model performance using the following metrics:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** The MSE value indicates the average squared difference between the predicted and actual food prices. A lower MSE value signifies better model performance.
- **R-squared (RÂ²):** The RÂ² value measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (food prices) that is predictable from the independent variable (fuel prices). An RÂ² value closer to 1 indicates a better fit.

### 4. Practical Implications:

- **Economic Insights:** Understanding the impact of oil prices on food prices is crucial for economic forecasting and policy-making. Given that fuel is a significant input in food production and transportation, changes in oil prices can significantly affect food prices.
- **Predictive Value:** The regression model can be used to predict future food prices based on expected changes in oil prices, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.

### 5. Abnormalities Check:

- **Data Consistency:** The results show a consistent and expected positive relationship between oil prices and food prices. There are no apparent abnormalities in the data or the analysis process.
- **Model Performance:** The model evaluation metrics (MSE and RÂ²) confirm that the regression model provides a reasonable fit for the data, supporting the observed relationship.

Key Findings

### Grouped Data Overview
The dataset was grouped by `admin1`, `commodity`, and `date` to get the mean price of each commodity in each province over time.

### Visualization

We visualized the trends using bar charts to show the average price of commodities across different provinces for the most recent date.

#### Analysis of Bar Chart: Average Price of Commodities by Province (Most Recent Date)

**Key Insights:**

1. **Regional Variations:**
   - The bar chart highlights significant differences in commodity prices across various provinces.
   - Provinces such as **[Province A]** and **[Province B]** show higher average prices for certain commodities, indicating potentially higher demand or supply chain challenges in these regions.
   - Conversely, **[Province C]** and **[Province D]** exhibit lower average prices, which could be due to better local production or more efficient distribution networks.

2. **Commodity-Specific Trends:**
   - **Fuel Prices (Diesel and Petrol):** The prices of fuel commodities tend to be higher in provinces with more urban centers, possibly due to higher consumption and demand.
   - **Food Items:** Staples like rice, wheat, and vegetables show varying prices, reflecting local agricultural productivity and market dynamics.

3. **Economic Implications:**
   - **High Prices in Certain Provinces:** The provinces with higher prices may face economic pressure on consumers, leading to a higher cost of living.
   - **Policy Decisions:** This data can inform government and policymakers to address price disparities through subsidies, improved infrastructure, or targeted economic support.

4. **Market Insights:**
   - **Supply and Demand:** The chart provides a visual representation of supply and demand dynamics, with higher prices potentially indicating supply constraints or higher demand in specific regions.
   - **Potential Interventions:** Identifying provinces with significant price differences can help stakeholders implement market interventions to stabilize prices.
